        <p class = "tab">The Whisper Corners</p>
    <p class = "tab">The Whisper Corners are the meeting point of three hallways and a restaurant, below the main hall in Grand Central Station. When you are standing in the center, you smell the aroma of the food courts nearby and you hear the sounds of hundreds of footsteps above. The walls are made of marble that is cool to the touch, and the ceiling is an elegant pattern made up of small tiles. It is like a giant mural, with so much more love and detail than that which goes into buildings built now. </p>

<p class = "tab">One of my earliest memories that I have with my Dad is him taking me to see the Whisper Corners. My Dad told me to stand in one corner and listen while he hurried across to the opposite and started talking. I was completely shocked at how I could hear my Dad talking just like he was talking through a phone. I was also four years old so I didn’t know anything. I remember my dad saying that it was because of how the ceiling is shaped, and because of “physics,” which pretty much meant nothing to me. Maybe that is why even now I think of that place as being sort of magical. My Dad kept taking me to the Whisper Corners pretty frequently as I got older because his job was right near Grand Central. We also went there to catch a train to my grandparents’ house in Connecticut. Anytime we were near we would stop by the Corners, and anytime we had family come into the city we would show them off to them.
</p>
 <p class = "tab">Nowadays I haven’t been there in many years. My Dad switched jobs and we go to the station in Harlem to get the train now. I had almost completely forgotten about them until recently when I was talking with my parents. Now I’m old enough to understand how they work and the science behind them, but they have still kept their magical feeling for me.
I have always wondered why the Corners work the way they do. Was it intentionally made to be a telephone or did someone accidentally notice it after it was built? I always imagine the workers building the ceiling just taking a lunch break and resting on the floor talking. Maybe some are sitting in the corners and all of a sudden they notice that they can hear their buddies talking from across the room. Imagine what a surprise that would have been! I don’t think I will ever learn the real answer though. Maybe I don’t even want to know.
</p>
<p class = "tab">I feel that the Whisper Corners show an interesting thing about how people think, and even how society thinks. The Corners are very important to me and have a special place in my heart, but plenty of people speed through those hallways every day and think nothing of them. It’s not that nobody knows about them; it’s just that many don’t care or are busy on their way to work. Plenty of tourists will come and see the main station hall and the big clock and never even know about the Whisper Corners, while I couldn’t care less about the clock. It’s a nice clock, and the ceiling art in that room is very impressive and all, but I have no personal attachment to it. I have no memories of seeing it. The people who commute through the Corners every day definitely don’t stop and check them out all the time. Some probably don’t even know about them. Would I care about them if I saw them every single day? This makes me think about all the things that I walk by everyday that probably mean something special to someone else and I will never even know. Everyone has these types of places, usually because of early memories or childhood, and most of the time their places would mean nothing to somebody else. I think a lot of the time, the most famous tourist attractions are not the places that are actually most important to people. As an example, I don’t think I know a single New Yorker who cares about the Statue of Liberty. When we think of New York City, we are thinking of the packed subways, the dirty streets, and the things that we actually experience. I have lived here my whole life and have never gone to the Empire State Building. The places that are important to people are not famous and they are not tourist attractions. They are places that have a special meaning for those people, and a place that is real and unique to only them.
